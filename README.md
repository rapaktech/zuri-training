This is my GitHub project for the HNG/ZuriBoard Developer Training.

I signed up to the JavaScript backend (NodeJS) class.

The project will be used to study any concepts that will be taught during the course of the training, as well as any assignments or tasks.

I am looking forward to learning about JS as I continue on my way to becoming a backend developer.
